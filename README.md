# Safe Lane Change by Using Finite State Machine and Control Barrier Functions

## Abstract
For autonomous vehicles, performing lane change maneuvers in a safe and smooth manner is crucial. This project develops a high-level decision-maker for model predictive contouring control (MPCC). By integrating a finite state machine (FSM) with a safety judgment mechanism, our approach actively avoids obstacles and optimizes lane changing trajectory using B-splines. In the lower execution layer, MPCC is combined with the control barrier function (CBF) for safe local path planning and optimal control input determination under a wide range of road conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
